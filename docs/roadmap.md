# Roadmap — WLM‑Agent‑Behavior  
**From MVP → tension‑driven → closure‑aware → multi‑agent behavior**

This roadmap outlines the evolution of WLM‑Agent‑Behavior from  
a minimal deterministic pipeline into a fully structured behavioral engine.

---

# Phase 1 — MVP (Current)
**Goal:** Establish a clean, deterministic behavior pipeline.

### Deliverables
- policy engine (noop strategy)  
- tension resolver (empty)  
- closure planner (empty)  
- behavior emitter (deterministic)  
- CLI: `wlm-agent-behavior compute-behavior`  
- documentation: overview, rules, API, roadmap  

### Success Criteria
- end‑to‑end pipeline runs deterministically  
- stable BehaviorPlan structure  
- clean extension points  

---

# Phase 2 — Tension‑Driven Behavior
**Goal:** Resolve structural tensions into actions.

### Deliverables
- contact tension → disengage  
- instability → stabilize  
- causal preconditions → satisfy_precondition  
- tension prioritization  

### Success Criteria
- tensions produce consistent actions  
- no contradictory resolutions  

---

# Phase 3 — Closure‑Aware Planning
**Goal:** Anticipate future structural states.

### Deliverables
- predicted collisions → avoidance  
- predicted interactions → preparation  
- predicted instability → pre‑stabilization  
- temporal prioritization  

### Success Criteria
- behavior anticipates future states  
- no reactive-only behavior  

---

# Phase 4 — Dimension‑Aligned Behavior
**Goal:** Use WLM dimensions to guide behavior.

### Deliverables
- spatial navigation  
- temporal sequencing  
- physical stabilization  
- causal affordance actions  

### Success Criteria
- dimension-consistent behavior  
- no dimension contradictions  

---

# Phase 5 — Multi‑Agent Behavior
**Goal:** Shared structural behavior across agents.

### Deliverables
- multi‑agent tension fusion  
- consensus planning  
- conflict resolution  
- shared structural substrate  

### Success Criteria
- stable multi‑agent coordination  
- no behavioral divergence  

---

# Phase 6 — Real‑Time Structural Policy Engine
**Goal:** Continuous behavior from streaming WLMGraphs.

### Deliverables
- streaming behavior updates  
- structural diff engine  
- real‑time tension monitoring  
- real‑time closure planning  

### Success Criteria
- <50ms behavior updates  
- stable behavior across frames

# Summary

WLM‑Agent‑Behavior evolves through:

1. **MVP** — deterministic pipeline  
2. **Tension‑driven** — resolve structural pressures  
3. **Closure‑aware** — anticipate future states  
4. **Dimension‑aligned** — spatial/temporal/physical/causal  
5. **Multi‑agent** — shared structural behavior  
6. **Real‑time** — continuous structural policy engine  

This roadmap transforms WLM from **structured perception** into  
**structured, reproducible, controllable agent behavior**.
